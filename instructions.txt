Test the URL Shortener Application

1. Start the Application:
   - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
   - Run 'npm start' to start the server.

2. Test URL Creation with Postman:
   - Open Postman and create a new POST request.
   - Set the request URL to 'http://localhost:8001/url'.
   - In the 'Body' tab, select 'raw' and choose 'JSON'.
   - Enter the URL you want to shorten in the format: {"url": "https://www.example.com"}.
   - Send the request and note down the shortId returned in the response.

3. Test URL Redirection with Postman:
   - Create a new GET request in Postman.
   - Set the request URL to 'http://localhost:8001/:shortId', replacing ':shortId' with the actual shortId received from the previous step.
   - Send the request. The response should redirect you to the original URL you shortened.

4. Test URL Creation and Redirection in a Web Browser:
   - To test redirection, simply enter 'http://localhost:8001/:shortId' in your browser's address bar, again replacing ':shortId' with your specific shortId.
